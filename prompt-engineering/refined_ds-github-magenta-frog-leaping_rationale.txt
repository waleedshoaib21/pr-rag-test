## Rationale

The improved prompt addresses the weaknesses identified in the benchmarks in the following ways:

- The prompt now provides a specific task. The user is asked to analyze a given FOMC statement, providing a summary, explaining its implications, and making predictions for future monetary policy.
- The prompt uses placeholders ({FOMC_statement}) to clarify where the user should interact with the FOMC statement.
- The term 'FOMC' is defined for users who may not be familiar with it.
- The prompt provides clear instructions for analysis, including requirements for evidence-based analysis, neutrality, and avoidance of unsupported assumptions.
- The prompt specifies an output format, providing further clarity on what is expected from the user.

The improved prompt also provides depth of instruction, aligns with an implied analysis framework (summary, implications, predictions), and is contextually relevant to FOMC analysis.
