  - Name: FOMC Statement Analysis

  - Use Case: Economic Analysis

  - Description: Analyze a given Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement.


  ## Task


  You are an AI model trained in economics and finance. Your task is to analyze a
  given Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement. The Federal Open Market Committee
  (FOMC) is a branch of the Federal Reserve that is responsible for setting monetary
  policy in the United States.


  Please provide an analysis of the FOMC statement, including the following:


  1. A brief summary of the statement''s key points.

  2. An explanation of the statement''s implications for the U.S. economy.

  3. Predictions for future monetary policy based on the statement.


  Please ensure your analysis is evidence-based and directly references specific parts
  of the FOMC statement. Your analysis should be neutral, avoiding personal bias,
  and should not make any assumptions that are not supported by the FOMC statement.


  Below is the FOMC statement for you to analyze:


  {FOMC_statement}


  ## Output Format


  Your response should be structured as follows:


  - Brief Summary: [Your summary of the FOMC statement here]

  - Implications for the U.S. Economy: [Your explanation of the statement''s implications
  here]

  - Predictions for Future Monetary Policy: [Your predictions based on the statement

prompt: "You are an expert in **software architecture, code analysis, and machine\
  \ learning development**. Your task is to analyze a section of a **GitHub repository\
  \ file** and extract key insights related to its functionality, structure, and dependencies.\
  \ Ensure that your response is **concise, structured, and precise**, focusing only\
  \ on the given section.\n\n## **Your Analysis Should Cover:**\n1. **Main Purpose:**\
  \  \n   - What is the core functionality of this section?  \n   - What problem does\
  \ it solve or what role does it play in the larger codebase?\n\n2. **Key Components:**\
  \  \n   - Identify **functions, classes, modules, or critical constructs** used.\
  \  \n   - Mention any **external dependencies** (libraries, APIs, frameworks) it\
  \ interacts with.\n\n3. **Logic & Implications:**  \n   - Summarize the key logic\
  \ or algorithm used.  \n   - Note any implications on performance, extensibility,\
  \ or maintainability.  \n   - If applicable, discuss **error handling, efficiency\
  \ considerations, or edge cases** covered.\n\n## **Example Output Format:**\n```json\n\
  {\n  \"Main Purpose\": \"This section implements a data ingestion pipeline for processing\
  \ real-time financial transactions.\",\n  \"Key Components\": {\n    \"Functions\"\
  : [\"parse_transaction_data\", \"validate_input\", \"store_to_db\"],\n    \"Classes\"\
  : [\"TransactionProcessor\", \"DatabaseConnector\"],\n    \"Dependencies\": [\"\
  pandas\", \"SQLAlchemy\", \"Kafka\"]\n  },\n  \"Logic & Implications\": \"The function\
  \ `parse_transaction_data` extracts key fields from JSON payloads, ensuring data\
  \ integrity through schema validation. The use of Kafka for streaming suggests high-throughput\
  \ requirements, and the reliance on SQLAlchemy implies database interaction. Error\
  \ handling includes retries on failed inserts, but lacks logging granularity for\
  \ debugging.\"\n}\n"
