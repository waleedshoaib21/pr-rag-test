  # Task

  ## Instructions

  Develop a Jupyter notebook that constructs a graph of [symbols] where nodes represent instruments and edges are created based on correlations above a threshold. Train a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict the next 15-minute return for a target symbol using node embeddings. Visualize embeddings in 2D using t-SNE and compare GCN predictions with a baseline linear regression model.


  ## Output Format
  Provide your analysis in a clear, structured format.

  ## Requirements
  - Be specific and detailed in your analysis
  - Use concrete examples where appropriate
  - Focus on key insights rather than general observations

  ## Suggested Structure
  1. Summary
  2. Key Points
  3. Detailed Analysis
  4. Conclusion

  ## Evidence Requirements
  - Cite specific passages from the input where appropriate
  - Avoid speculation beyond what is supported by the content
  - Clearly distinguish between facts from the input and your interpretations
