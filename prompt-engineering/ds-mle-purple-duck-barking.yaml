  Develop a Jupyter notebook that constructs a graph of [symbols] where nodes represent instruments and edges are created based on correlations above a threshold. Train a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict the next 15-minute return for a target symbol using node embeddings. Visualize embeddings in 2D using t-SNE and compare GCN predictions with a baseline linear regression model.
