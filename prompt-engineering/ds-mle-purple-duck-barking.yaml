  ## Prompt

  As a Graph Data Scientist in a financial setting, you are tasked with designing a predictive model for financial instruments using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Your task will be split into four major parts:

  1. **Data Preparation**: Using a Jupyter notebook, construct a graph where each node represents a financial instrument (identified by its trading symbol), and an edge is created between two nodes if the correlation between the historical returns of the two instruments exceeds a pre-determined threshold.

  2. **Model Development**: Train a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on the graph you constructed. The goal of the GCN is to predict the return of a target financial instrument for the next 15-minute interval. The training should utilize the node embeddings generated by the GCN.

  3. **Visualization**: Visualize the node embeddings generated by the GCN in 2 dimensions using t-SNE.

  4. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the GCN model with a baseline linear regression model. The comparison should include both the predicted and actual returns for the target symbol.

  Please ensure your output includes the Jupyter notebook code for data preparation, model development, visualization, and performance evaluation.

  ## Deliverables

  1. Jupyter Notebook with all the code for data preparation, model development, visualization, and performance comparison.
  2. A 2D visualization of the node embeddings using t-SNE.
  3. A comparison of the predicted versus actual returns for the target symbol from the GCN and linear regression models.
