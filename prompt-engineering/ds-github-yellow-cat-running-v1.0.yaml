  Write a brief explanation of the LASSO regression model for beginners in data science. Your explanation should:

  1. Define LASSO regression in simple terms.
  2. Discuss the fundamental concept behind LASSO regression, why it's important, and how it differs from other types of regression models.
  3. Mention the situations where LASSO regression is particularly useful.
  4. Briefly explain the mathematical basis of LASSO regression, but remember to keep it understandable for beginners.
  5. Include a simple real-world example to illustrate how LASSO regression can be applied.

  Ensure your explanation is clear, concise, and avoids technical jargon as much as possible. Aim for a length of around 300-500 words.
