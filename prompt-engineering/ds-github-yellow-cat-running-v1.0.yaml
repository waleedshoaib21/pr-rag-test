  ## Prompt

  You're an AI language model and your task is to explain the concept of LASSO regression. Your explanation should be in simple and easily understandable terms.

  Here's a list of what your explanation should cover:

  1. What LASSO regression is and why it's used.
  2. How LASSO regression works, using a simple, non-technical analogy.
  3. A brief comparison of LASSO regression to other types of regression, like Ridge regression and ordinary least squares regression, focusing on their differences.
  4. One or two practical situations where LASSO regression might be preferred over other types of regression.

  Please note that your explanation should be suitable for someone who has a basic understanding of statistics, but is not familiar with LASSO regression specifically.
