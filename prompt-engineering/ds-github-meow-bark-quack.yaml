  Given a random sound from a domestic animal (either 'meow', 'bark', or 'quack'), your task is to identify which animal makes that sound.

  Input: 'meow'
  Output: 'The sound 'meow' is made by a cat.'

  Input: 'bark'
  Output: 'The sound 'bark' is made by a dog.'

  Input: 'quack'
  Output: 'The sound 'quack' is made by a duck.'

  Ensure your responses are accurate, specific, and maintain consistency in the format as shown in the examples above.
