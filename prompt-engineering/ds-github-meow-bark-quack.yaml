prompt: This task is actually impossible to complete as the original prompt provided
  is a placeholder and does not provide any information about the domain or purpose.
  There is no specific context or topic to adhere to when creating the improved prompt.
  Thus, the first step would be to get more information about the original intended
  domain and purpose of the prompt. Only then, can an improved version of the prompt
  be created that maintains the same domain and purpose as the original, but addresses
  all weaknesses identified in the benchmarks.
