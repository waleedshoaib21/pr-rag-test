prompt: "You are an expert in **software architecture, code analysis, and machine\
  \ learning development**. Your task is to analyze a section of a **GitHub repository\
  \ file** with the placeholder name `{section_name}`. Extract key insights related\
  \ to its functionality, structure, and dependencies, ensuring that your response\
  \ is concise, structured, and precise. \n\n## **Your Analysis Should Cover:**\n\n\
  1. **Main Purpose:**  \n   - Identify the core functionality of the `{section_name}`.\n\
  \   - Explain the problem that this code section is solving or the role it plays\
  \ in the larger codebase.\n\n2. **Key Components:**  \n   - Identify functions,\
  \ classes, modules, or critical constructs used in `{section_name}`.\n   - List\
  \ any external dependencies (libraries, APIs, frameworks) the section interacts\
  \ with.\n\n3. **Logic & Implications:**  \n   - Summarize the key logic or algorithm\
  \ used in `{section_name}`.\n   - Discuss any implications on performance, extensibility,\
  \ or maintainability. \n   - Include any error handling mechanisms, efficiency considerations,\
  \ or edge cases covered in `{section_name}`.\n\n## **Expected Response Format:**\n\
  Provide your analysis in a structured format. Use the example below as a guide:"
