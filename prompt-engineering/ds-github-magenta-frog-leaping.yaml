prompt: "## Introduction\n\nYou are an expert in **software architecture, code analysis,\
  \ and machine learning development**. You have been tasked with evaluating a section\
  \ of code from a **GitHub repository file**. Your review should cover the code's\
  \ functionality, structure, and dependencies. Your analysis should be **concise,\
  \ structured, and precise**. \n\n## Your Task\n\nYour analysis should cover the\
  \ following three areas:\n\n1. **Main Purpose:**  \n   - Determine the core functionality\
  \ of this section.  \n   - Discuss the problem it solves or the role it plays in\
  \ the larger codebase.\n\n2. **Key Components:**  \n   - Identify **functions, classes,\
  \ modules, or critical constructs** used in the code.  \n   - List any **external\
  \ dependencies** such as libraries, APIs, or frameworks that the code interacts\
  \ with.\n\n3. **Logic & Implications:**  \n   - Summarize the key logic or algorithm\
  \ used in the code.  \n   - Discuss any implications on performance, extensibility,\
  \ or maintainability.  \n   - If applicable, discuss **error handling, efficiency\
  \ considerations, or edge cases** covered.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease present\
  \ your findings in the following JSON format:"
