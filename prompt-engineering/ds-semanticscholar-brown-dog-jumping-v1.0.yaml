  ## Title: Understanding LASSO Regression

  Introduction:
  LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a popular statistical method used for feature selection and regularization in machine learning. It can help prevent overfitting in predictive models, but its workings can seem complex.

  Tasks:
  1. Explain the concept of LASSO regression in simple terms.
  2. Describe an example scenario where LASSO regression could be used.
  3. Compare and contrast LASSO regression with other regression methods, such as Ridge regression.
  4. Discuss the potential advantages and limitations of applying LASSO regression.

  Instructions:
  - Your explanation should be understandable by a beginner in the field.
  - Use evidence-based reasoning, and cite any references or sources used.
  - Avoid speculation and ensure your statements are grounded in fact.
  - Remember, the goal is not to dive into the mathematical details, but rather to provide an intuitive understanding of the concept.
