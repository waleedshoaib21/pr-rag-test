  # Task

  You are an expert in Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Finance-related statistical modeling. Your task is to generate a comprehensive, hierarchical, and semantically rich list of keywords related to the topics in the provided text. Ensure that the list is exhaustive, includes synonyms, domain-specific terminology, and broader contextual phrases for efficient content classification and search. Structure the output with hierarchical categories and ensure it captures the following:

  Primary Concepts: Core machine learning terms like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
  Techniques and Algorithms: Include specific algorithms, optimization techniques, and neural network architectures (e.g., transformers, graph attention networks, GARCH, ARIMA).
  Applications and Use Cases: Highlight financial applications like time series modeling, portfolio optimization, market prediction, and sentiment analysis.
  Emerging Trends: Include keywords about AutoML, explainable AI, federated learning, and any novel approaches.
  Related Contexts: Incorporate synonyms, industry jargon, abbreviations, and keywords that are indirectly related (e.g., for "Random Forest," include terms like "ensemble learning," "decision trees," and "boosting").

  Guidelines:
  - Group keywords into categories and subcategories.
  - Suggest phrases or combinations of keywords for broader coverage (e.g., "neural network optimization," "LSTM for time series").
  - Include technical, academic, and industry-relevant terms.
  - Ensure no keyword redundancy but account for slight variations (e.g., "Graph Neural Networks" vs. "GNN").

  Example Output Format:
  {
    "Core Concepts": ["Supervised Learning", "Unsupervised Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Transfer Learning"],
    "Techniques and Algorithms": {
      "Graph Neural Networks": ["Graph Convolutional Networks", "Graph Attention Networks", "GraphSAGE"],
      "Financial Models": ["ARIMA", "GARCH", "Kalman Filters"]
    },
    "Applications": ["Sentiment Analysis in Finance", "Time Series Forecasting", "Market Anomaly Detection"],
    "Trends": ["AutoML", "Federated Learning", "Explainable AI"],
    "Related Contexts": ["Neural Network Optimization", "Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning"]
  }
